To profile users, you need to either create a new profile in our server or pass us a profileId obtained from your authentication services in the SDK.
We automatically create an anonymous profile for every installation of the app. You can check that a profile was created by checking the existance of a profile ID.
```java
String profileId = NearItUserProfile.getProfileId(context);
```
If the result is null, it means that no profile is associated with the app installation (probably due to a network error).

To explicitly register an user in our platform call the method
```java
NearItUserProfile.createNewProfile(this, new ProfileCreationListener() {
            @Override
            public void onProfileCreated(boolean created, String profileId) {
                // see the created boolean to know if the profile was freshly created or was already created 
            }

            @Override
            public void onProfileCreationError(String error) {
                
            }
        });
```
Calling this method multiple times will NOT results in multiple profiles being created.

After the profile is created set user data
```java
NearItUserProfile.setUserData(context, "name", "John", new UserDataNotifier() {
    @Override
    public void onDataCreated() {
        // data was set/created                                                
    }
                                                       
    @Override
    public void onDataNotSetError(String error) {
        // there was an error                        
    }
});
```

If you have multiple data properties, set them in batch
```java
HashMap<String, String> userDataMap = new HashMap<>();
userDataMap.put("name", "John");
userDataMap.put("age", "23");           // set everything as String
userDataMap.put("saw_tutorial", "true") // even booleans, the server has all the right logic
NearItUserProfile.setBatchUserData(context, userDataMap, new UserDataNotifier() {
            @Override
            public void onDataCreated() {
                // data was set/created 
            }

            @Override
            public void onDataNotSetError(String error) {

            }
        });
```
If you try to set user data before creating a profile the error callback will be called.

If you want to set a profileId manually (if it's coming from your user management systems) use the method
```java
NearItUserProfile.setProfileId(context, profileId);
```

If you want to reset your profile use this method
```java
NearItUserProfile.resetProfileId(context)
```
Further calls to NearItUserProfile.getProfileId(context) will return null.
A creation of a new profile after the reset will create a profile with no user data.
