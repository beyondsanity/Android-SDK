# Handle recipe content #

NearIT takes care of delivering content at the right time, you will just need to handle content presentation. 

## Foreground vs Background ##

Recipes either deliver content in the background or in the foreground but not both. Check this table to see how you will be notified.

| Type of trigger                  | Delivery           |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Push (immediate or scheduled)    | Background intent  |
| Enter and Exit on geofences      | Background intent  |
| Enter and Exit on beacon regions | Background intent  |
| Enter in a specific beacon range | Proximity listener (foreground) |

## Foreground content ##

To receive foreground contents (e.g. ranging recipes) set a proximity listener with the method
```java
{
    ...
    nearItManager.addProximityListener(this);
    // remember to remove the listener when the object is being destroyed with 
    // nearItManager.removeProximityListener(this);
    ...
}

@Override
public void foregroundEvent(Parcelable content, Recipe recipe) {
    // handle the event
    // if you show the notification to the user track the recipe as notified with
    // Recipe.sendTracking(getApplicationContext(), recipe.getId(), Recipe.NOTIFIED_STATUS);
    // when the user interacts with the content, track the event with
    // Recipe.sendTracking(getApplicationContext(), recipe.getId(), Recipe.ENGAGED_STATUS);
    // To extract the content and to have it automatically casted to the appropriate object type
    // NearUtils.parseCoreContents(content, recipe, coreContentListener)
}   
```

## Background content ##

Once you have added at least one of the receivers for any background working trigger (ADD LINK) you will be delivered the actual content through an intent that will call your app launcher activity and carry some extras.
To extract the content from an intent use the utility method:
```java
NearUtils.parseCoreContents(intent, coreContentListener);
```

Recipes tracks themselves as notified, but you need to track the tap event, by calling
```java
Recipe.sendTracking(getApplicationContext(), recipeId, Recipe.ENGAGED_STATUS);
```
If you want to customize the behavior of background notification see [this page](docs/custom-background-notifications.md)

## Content objects ##

For each callback method of the *coreContentListener* you will receive a different content object. 
Here are the details for each one:

- `SimpleNotification` with the following getters:
    - `getNotificationMessage()` returns the notification message
    - `getNotificationTitle()` returns the notification title
    
- `Content` for the notification with content, with the following getters:
    - `getContent()` returns the text content
    - `getVideo_link()` returns the video link string
    - `getImages_links()` returns a list of *ImageSet* object containing the source links for the images
    
- `Feedback` with the following getters:
    - `getQuestion()` returns the feedback request string
    - `getRecipeId()` returns the recipeId associated with the feedback (you'll need it for answer it)
    
- `Coupon` with the following getters:
    - `getName()` returns the coupon name
    - `getDescription()` returns the coupon description
    - `getValue()` returns the value string
    - `getExpires_at()` returns the expiring date (as a string)
    - `getIconSet()` returns an *ImageSet* object containing the source links for the icon
    - `getSerial()` returns the serial code of the single coupon as a string
    - `getClaimedAt()` returns the claimed date (when the coupon was earned) of the coupon as a string
    - `getRedeemedAt()` returns the redeemed date (when the coupon was used) of the coupon as a string
    
- `CustomJSON` with the following getters:
    - `getContent()` returns the json content as an *HashMap<String, Object>* (just like Gson)
